	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    Argynguard is an identity verification utility designed for high-risk environments.
    It is strictly a verification tool to protect against impersonation and deepfakes;
    it is <strong>not</strong> a secure messaging or communication platform.
</p>

<h3>1. Required Permissions</h3>

<h4>Camera Access</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Required to scan QR codes for the 'Ephemeral Handshake' (Identity Exchange).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Images are processed in Random Access Memory (RAM) for QR detection and immediately discarded.</li>
    <li><strong>No Persistence:</strong> No video or photos are ever saved to storage or transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Biometrics (FaceID / Fingerprint)</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Required to unlock the hardware-backed encryption keys (Secure Enclave) that protect your database.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The app never accesses your actual biometric data. We only receive a cryptographic 'token' from the operating system upon successful verification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Data Processing & Storage</h3>

<h4>Contact Metadata (Names/Photos)</h4>
<p>
    Stored locally in an encrypted SQLite database (AES-256). This data is used solely to display your personal directory of verified contacts.
</p>

<h4>Cryptographic Secrets (Keys)</h4>
<p>
    Master keys are wrapped by the device's Secure Enclave. Session keys are derived temporarily in RAM.
</p>
<h4>No Backup Possibility</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Intentional Limitation:</strong> To the best of our knowledge, there is no mechanism to back up, export, or transfer this data to another device. This restriction is a deliberate security feature designed to neutralize sophisticated cloning and offline brute-force attacks.
</p>
<h4>Network & Cloud</h4>
<p>
    Argynguard operates on an <strong>'Offline-First'</strong> architecture. We have no servers, no trackers, and no analytics. No data is ever transmitted off the device by the app.

        <strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> We cannot recover your account or access your data, even under court order, because we do not hold the keys.
